## Reporting my Proces

This homework was a lot of fun and I really enjoyed making an interactive shiny app. I think this will be usefull if I need to showcase my data and even if i just want to explore my own data in an interactive way. I also struggled with uploading the app to shiny.io - the actual upload process was simple and easy but I kept getting an error regarding one of my variables and had to dig a while to figure out the issue.

Of course I did not have the ability (or the time) to create a lot of the features I would have liked to add
- the option to include multiple countries (at least 3 or 4)
- the option to include all countries from a particular region
- the option to compare one region to another
- the option to explore not just GRI but the specific questions under it for each country
- lists countries in increasing order of GRI for any specific year

Eventually I would want to create something like this (or even better):
