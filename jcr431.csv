43,1,"Continuity Through Change: Navigating Temporalities Through Heirloom Rejuvenation","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 1, 1 June 2016, Pages 1–25, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw011","/jcr/article/43/1/1/2379668","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/1/1/2379668","This study explores how heirlooms, usually regarded as objects of family identity and stability, can also become objects of evolving personal identities and change. Our approach is based on the role of materiality (as well as meanings) and multi-temporality in heirloom consumption. The data generated through interviews, visual sources, and media documents reveal three rejuvenation processes that, given particular boundary conditions, renew heirlooms: uncovering, refreshing, and reconciliation. Our study also distinguishes three types of heirloom essence that can survive the heirloom’s material and compositional transformations. Rejuvenation reintegrates the heirloom into the heir’s life trajectory by imbuing it with a zeitgeist value and the heir’s presence, helping the heir to better navigate her imaginaries of the past, present, and future. Beyond the ritualistic consumption or curation of heirlooms, our findings reveal a creative, playful, and proactive relation with heirlooms, evocative of craftwork. Moreover, the market, within particular boundaries, can help authenticate heirloom objects and facilitate their inalienability rather than necessarily destroying their authenticity. Our study has implications for the role of heirloom consumption in consumers’ negotiations of continuity and change, the interaction of the symbolic and the material in heirlooms, and the inalienability–market relation.","Meltem Türe; Güliz Ger"
43,1,"When Boastful Word of Mouth Helps versus Hurts Social Perceptions and Persuasion","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 1, 1 June 2016, Pages 26–43, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw009","/jcr/article/43/1/26/2379652","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/1/26/2379652","Although self-enhancement has recently been established as a central motive for sharing word-of-mouth information, little is known about the impact of self-enhancing assertions (e.g., boasting) on persuasion. We theorize, and demonstrate in three studies, that although boasting is perceived negatively, such immodest self-presentations can either impede or enhance social perceptions and persuasion. The valence of the persuasion outcome depends heavily on trust cues that change the meaning of boasting to the word-of-mouth recipient. Boasting in the presence of low trust cues activates heightened vigilance (e.g., valenced thoughts) about the source’s motives, leading to decreased persuasion. However, when given reason to trust the source specifically or people generally, boasting is readily accepted as a signal of source expertise, leading to increased persuasion. Implications for consumer decision making and firms seeking to manage consumer social influence are discussed.","Grant Packard; Andrew D. Gershoff; David B. Wooten"
43,1,"Too Exciting to Fail, Too Sincere to Succeed: The Effects of Brand Personality on Sensory Disconfirmation","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 1, 1 June 2016, Pages 44–67, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw003","/jcr/article/43/1/44/2379589","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/1/44/2379589","Across four studies, the authors demonstrate that consumers intuitively link disconfirmation, specifically sensory disconfirmation (when touch disconfirms expectations by sight), to a brand’s personality. Negative disconfirmation is often associated with negative posttrial evaluations. However, the authors find that when negative sensory disconfirmation is introduced by an exciting brand, the source of disconfirmation can sometimes be perceived positively. This occurs because consumers intuitively view disconfirmation as more authentic of an exciting personality. Similarly, despite the wealth of literature linking positive disconfirmation to positive posttrial evaluations, the authors find that sensory confirmation is more preferred for sincere brands because consumers intuitively view confirmation as more authentic of a sincere personality. The authors conclude by demonstrating the intuitive nature of this phenomenon by showing that the lay belief linking brand personality to disconfirmation does not activate in a context where sensory disconfirmation encourages a more deliberative assessment of the product.","Aparna Sundar; Theodore J.

43,1,"Dynamics of Communicator and Audience Power: The Persuasiveness of Competence versus Warmth","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 1, 1 June 2016, Pages 68–85, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw006","/jcr/article/43/1/68/2379624","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/1/68/2379624","The current research offers a new theoretical perspective on the relationship between power and persuasion. An agentic-communal model of power is presented that proposes power affects both the messages generated by communicators and the messages that persuade audiences. Compared to low-power states, high-power states produce a greater emphasis on information that conveys competence. As a consequence, high-power communicators generate messages with greater competence information, and high-power audiences are persuaded more by competence information. In contrast to high-power states, low-power states produce a greater emphasis on information that conveys warmth. As a result, low-power communicators generate messages with greater warmth information, and low-power audiences are persuaded more by warmth information. Because of these two outcomes, a power-matching effect occurs between communicator and audience power: high-power communicators are more effective in persuading high-power audience members, whereas low-power communicators are more effective in persuading low-power audience members. Four experiments find support for these effects in oral and written contexts with three distinct manipulations of power. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that the persuasiveness of messages can be affected by the alignment between the psychological sense of power of the communicator and the audience.","David Dubois; Derek D.

43,1,"How Content Acquisition Method Affects Word of Mouth","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 1, 1 June 2016, Pages 86–102, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw001","/jcr/article/43/1/86/2379577","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/1/86/2379577","People often share word of mouth with others, and such social sharing is an integral part of everyday life. But the content (e.g., stories, news, information) that people transmit can be acquired in different ways. Sometimes people find content themselves, and other times people receive content from others (e.g., via email or conversation). Might these different acquisition methods impact subsequent sharing, and if so, how? Six studies demonstrate that acquisition method can impact transmission through changing how content is processed. Compared to received content, people are more likely to associate found content with themselves, which decreases processing. Reduced processing, in turn, lowers sensitivity to diagnostic content characteristics (e.g., whether content is interesting or well written), which reduces these characteristics’ impact on sharing. Thus while receivers are more likely to share interesting (than boring) content, the difference is attenuated (and in some cases, disappeared) among finders. These findings deepen insights into the psychological drivers of word of mouth and shed light on how contextual factors, content characteristics, and the self interact to drive social transmission.","Zoey Chen; Jonah Berger"
43,1,"Healthy-Left, Unhealthy-Right: Can Displaying Healthy Items to the Left (versus Right) of Unhealthy Items Nudge Healthier Choices?","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 1, 1 June 2016, Pages 103–112, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw008","/jcr/article/43/1/103/2379632","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/1/103/2379632","Would laterally displaying a healthy item to the left versus right of an unhealthy item influence choice and consumption? The results of seven studies demonstrate that displaying healthy items to the left (vs. right) of unhealthy items enhances preference for the healthy options. In addition, consumption volume of a healthy item (vis-à-vis an unhealthy item) is higher when it is placed to the left (vs. right) of the unhealthy item. We propose that a “healthy-left, unhealthy-right” (vs. healthy-right, unhealthy-left) lateral display pattern is congruent with consumers’ mental organization of food items varying in healthfulness, which enhances ease of processing and in turn enhances self-control, thereby leading to a relatively higher likelihood of choosing healthy options. While prior studies have examined the role of several factors in influencing choices between healthy and unhealthy options, the present research is the first to demonstrate the effects of lateral display positions of healthy/unhealthy options on choice and healthful consumption. The findings of our research have important implications for designing retail food displays and restaurant menus as well as for conducting research studies involving healthy and unhealthy food displays.","Marisabel Romero; Dipayan Biswas"
43,1,"Decision Comfort","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 1, 1 June 2016, Pages 113–133, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw010","/jcr/article/43/1/113/2379662","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/1/113/2379662","Contemporary consumer behavior research largely conceptualizes post-decision evaluation processes in terms of decision confidence, anticipated regret and satisfaction, and decision and consumption satisfaction. The current research broadens this view, arguing that people additionally experience varying degrees of decision comfort that are distinct from other post-decision evaluations. The authors argue that comfort is a soft-positive emotion thus far unexamined in relation to decision processes and present nine studies that (1) develop and validate two scales to measure decision comfort, (2) demonstrate the discriminant validity of decision comfort relative to numerous other post-decision constructs, and (3) examine the unique downstream consequences of decision comfort. The results show that an individual may be quite comfortable with a decision despite being uncertain about the optimality and/or the anticipated consequences of that decision (e.g., satisfaction or regret). It is demonstrated that decision comfort responds to affect-relevant cues and tends to rely less on comparisons between the chosen and foregone options (i.e., it tends to be a less comparative evaluation). Decision comfort is also shown to account for a sizable proportion of consumers’ overall decision evaluations and to have meaningful downstream consequences on marketing-relevant variables (e.g., choice commitment and the likelihood of recommending).","Jeffrey R.

As an alternative to conceptualizing saving money as goal-directed behavior, the present research examines the chronic tendencies of people to save money in a consistent and sustained manner through a personal saving orientation (PSO). Drawing upon theorizing on action control and research on forming and maintaining habits, the PSO emphasizes consistent, sustainable saving activities and incorporating them into one’s lifestyle. In a set of nine studies, the PSO scale is developed and its nomological, test-retest, discriminant, and predictive validities are established. The results also show that the PSO moderates the relationship between consumers’ financial knowledge and their accumulated savings. Additionally, low-PSO consumers are responsive to an intervention to help them save money. The PSO offers an effective method for understanding differences between consumers in their financial decision making and behaviors, and it can be used as a guide to encourage consistent and sustained saving practices.","Utpal Dholakia; Leona Tam; Sunyee Yoon; Nancy Wong"

This research explores the unique ways in which consumers respond to ads using this type of targeting (vs. to ads that use more traditional forms of targeting), demonstrating that a behaviorally targeted ad can act as a social label even when it contains no explicit labeling information. Instead, when consumers recognize that the marketer has made an inference about their identity in order to serve them the ad, the ad itself functions as an implied social label. Across four studies, behaviorally targeted ads lead consumers to make adjustments to their self-perceptions to match the implied label; these self-perceptions then impact behavior including purchase intentions for the advertised product and other behaviors related to the implied label. Importantly, these effects only hold when the label is plausibly connected to consumers’ prior behavior (i.e., when the targeting is at least moderately accurate).","Christopher A. Summers; Robert W.

43,1,"Why, When, and How Personal Control Impacts Information Processing: A Framework","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 1, 1 June 2016, Pages 179–197, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw013","/jcr/article/43/1/179/2379740","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/1/179/2379740","The present research investigates why, when, and how feelings of personal control influence the way consumers process product information. Four studies were conducted. The results show that under baseline conditions, consumers who believe they can control the environment (internal locus of control) show greater confidence in their emerging preference in a choice process and demonstrate higher levels of preference-supporting bias than consumers who believe the environment controls their fate (external locus of control). However, the opposite relationship between locus of control and confirmatory information processing occurs when a threat to personal control is encountered. When threatened, consumers with an internal (external) locus of control activate an accuracy (defense) goal that results in lower (higher) levels of confidence in their emerging preference and confirmatory information processing than consumers with an external (internal) locus of control. These findings are integrated within a general framework that accounts for the impact of personal control on information processing. The framework predicts and empirical evidence confirms that the alternative strategies adopted to process information at different levels of personal control affect both product choice and willingness to pay for a new product.","Anne-Sophie Chaxel"
