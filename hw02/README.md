## Reporting my process

First I created a new repo for the rest of the homework assignments for the course. I copied the repo and created a version control project on Rstudio which I saved locally. I then created a new folder in the repo for hw02 and made a readme file within the hw02 folder which I pulled to the Rstudio project.

For this homework I first created the skeleton of the file with sections for each part of the assignment. I also created sections for content and reporting in the readme file. I realized my previous assignment was not as well formatted in terms of user friendliness or readability and  wanted to improve on that.
