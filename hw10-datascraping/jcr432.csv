43,2,"A Tutorial in Consumer Research: Knowledge Creation and Knowledge Appreciation in Deductive-Conceptual Consumer Research","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 2, 1 August 2016, Pages 200–209, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw023","/jcr/article/43/2/200/2572305","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/2/200/2572305"," A typical article in a top-tier business journal can require as much as $400,000 in academic labor costs (Terwiesch and Ulrich 2014). This estimate raises the question of what makes a contribution worthy of such a significant financial investment. How does an academic community determine the value of a contribution? We propose that two criteria inform judgments of value: the amount of knowledge creation and the amount of knowledge appreciation. Implicit in our view is the idea that researchers should know how to create valuable knowledge and be able to anticipate how much stakeholders will appreciate that knowledge. In this tutorial, we discuss knowledge creation, knowledge appreciation, and a framework that jointly represents these two sources of value. We hope that this framework will encourage scholars to engage in research activities that are valued by the scientific community. ","Chris Janiszewski; Aparna A. Labroo; Derek D. Rucker"
43,2,"Does Variety Among Activities Increase Happiness?","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 2, 1 August 2016, Pages 210–229, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw021","/jcr/article/43/2/210/2572296","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/2/210/2572296","Does variety increase happiness? Eight studies examine how the variety among the activities that fill people’s day-to-day lives affects subsequent happiness. The studies demonstrate that whether variety increases or decreases happiness depends on the perceived duration of the time within which the activities occur. For longer time periods (like a day), variety does increase happiness. However, for shorter time periods (like an hour), variety instead decreases happiness. This reversal stems from people’s sense of stimulation and productivity during that time. Whereas filling longer time periods with more varied activities makes the time feel more stimulating (which increases happiness), filling shorter time periods with more varied activities makes the time feel less productive (which decreases happiness). These effects are robust across actual and perceived variety, actual and perceived time duration, and multiple types of activities (work and leisure, self-selected and imposed, social and solo). Together the findings confirm that “variety is the spice of life”—but not of an hour.","Jordan Etkin; Cassie Mogilner"
43,2,"Wanting Ever More: Acquisition Procedure Motivates Continued Reward Acquisition","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 2, 1 August 2016, Pages 230–245, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw017","/jcr/article/43/2/230/2572282","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/2/230/2572282","What drives consumers to invest repeated efforts to acquire rewards? This research shows that the temporal arrangement of effort investment and reward dispensation can affect people’s motivation to earn more rewards. Two procedures for acquiring rewards are examined: a piecemeal procedure, whereby rewards are acquired gradually through repeated small efforts, and a lump-sum procedure, whereby a number of rewards are acquired all at once after a longer period of work. Holding constant the total quantity of acquired rewards and the effort–reward exchange rate, the piecemeal procedure is more motivating than the lump-sum procedure (experiment 1) because the former results in a greater sense of achievement (experiment 2). If the sense of achievement is curtailed by preventing people from accumulating the rewards they have earned (experiment 3), by providing rewards that are different from the already-earned rewards (experiment 4), or by breaking the association between effort and rewards (experiment 5), the piecemeal procedure is no more motivating than the lump-sum procedure. The effect is also diminished when consumers are satiated with the rewards (experiment 6). Taken together, these experiments provide converging evidence that acquiring rewards piece by piece motivates people to continue earning them.","Yan Zhang; Leilei Gao"
43,2,"The Recycled Self: Consumers’ Disposal Decisions of Identity-Linked Products","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 2, 1 August 2016, Pages 246–264, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw014","/jcr/article/43/2/246/2572264","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/2/246/2572264","It has been known for some time that consumers’ identities influence purchasing decisions and people form strong identity connections, or “links,” with products and brands. However, research has yet to determine whether identity-linked products are differentially treated at disposal in comparison to products that are not identity linked. Across seven studies, the current research shows that when an everyday product (e.g., paper, cups, aluminum cans) is linked to a consumer’s identity, it is less likely to be trashed and more likely to be recycled. Further, the tendency to recycle an identity-linked product increases with the strength and positivity of the connection between the consumer and product (or brand). Finally, the disposal behavior can be explained by consumers’ motivation to avoid trashing a product that is linked to the self because it is viewed as an identity threat. In sum, consumers will be more likely to recycle (rather than trash) a product if the product is linked to a consumer’s identity. This occurs because placing an identity-linked product in the trash is symbolically similar to trashing a part of the self, a situation consumers are motivated to avoid.","Remi Trudel; Jennifer J.

When others’ status is not superior (similar or inferior), high-PDB consumers are more likely to engage in status consumption than low-PDB consumers. However, when others’ status is superior, high-PDB consumers are less likely to engage in status consumption. Both signaling effectiveness and need for status underlie the effect of PDB on status consumption. Need for status mediates the effect of PDB only when others’ status is not superior, whereas signaling effectiveness mediates the effect of PDB on status consumption when others’ status is superior, similar, or inferior. Compared to low-PDB consumers, high-PDB consumers perceive greater signaling effectiveness when others’ status is inferior or similar, but they perceive less signaling effectiveness, and therefore engage in less status consumption, when others’ status is superior. When status goods are consumed in private, and therefore not effective at signaling status, the interaction of others’ status and PDB is mitigated. This research articulates the nuanced effect of PDB on status consumption depending on others’ status as well as the multiple mechanisms underlying status consumption.","Huachao Gao; Karen Page Winterich; Yinlong Zhang"

To fill this gap, the current study examined the effect of anthropomorphic representations of computerized helpers in computer games on game enjoyment. In the current research, consumers enjoyed a computer game less when they received assistance from a computerized helper imbued with humanlike features than from a helper construed as a mindless entity. We offer a novel mechanism that the presence of an anthropomorphized helper can undermine individuals’ perceived autonomy during a computer game. Across six experiments, we show that the presence of an anthropomorphized helper reduced game enjoyment across three different games. By measuring participants’ perceived autonomy (study 1) and employing moderators such as importance of autonomy (studies 2, 3, and 4), we also provide evidence that the reduced feeling of autonomy serves as the mechanism underlying the backfiring effect. Finally, we demonstrate that the effect of anthropomorphism on game enjoyment can be extended to other game-related outcomes, such as individuals’ motivation to persist in the game (studies 4 and 5).","Sara Kim; Rocky Peng Chen; Ke Zhang"
43,2,"Numbers Are Gendered: The Role of Numerical Precision","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 2, 1 August 2016, Pages 303–316, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw020","/jcr/article/43/2/303/2572294","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/2/303/2572294","Marketing communications often contain numerical information that can be expressed more or less precisely. Earlier research has identified a number of ways in which consumers respond differently to precise versus round numbers. The current research attempts to enrich this literature by introducing a new theoretical perspective. Drawing on recent findings in the numerical cognition literature, this work proposes that individuals project gendered meanings to precise versus round numbers, with precise numbers seen as more masculine relative to round ones. Seven studies provided convergent evidence for this proposition and demonstrated its marketing implications. Studies 1, 2, and 3, employing various approaches, show that participants do subscribe to this precision-masculinity intuition, at both implicit and explicit levels. Study 4 suppresses this effect by priming participants with examples where precision is connected to femininity. Building on these findings, subsequent studies demonstrate that marketing communications using precise (round) numbers lead to more favorable evaluations when the products or attributes are positioned as masculine (feminine).","Dengfeng Yan"

The Impact of Power Distance Belief on Price-Quality Judgments","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 2, 1 August 2016, Pages 317–333, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw019","/jcr/article/43/2/317/2572289","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/2/317/2572289","The role of cultural factors in influencing price perceptions is not understood well in the literature. The present research seeks to fill this gap by examining the link between power distance belief—the acceptance and endorsement of power disparities in society—and the tendency to use the price of a product to judge its quality, the underlying processes, and boundary conditions. Three studies show that consumers high (vs. low) in power distance belief have a greater tendency to use price to judge quality because they have a greater need for structure, which makes them more likely to discriminate between brands and rank them based on price. The relationships held regardless of whether the price-to-quality relation was assessed using a standard self-report scale or via actual product judgments, and whether power distance belief was measured or manipulated. The effect was found to be independent of self-construal, holistic thinking, and risk aversion, was mediated by a need for structure, and disappeared when the tendency to order was facilitated (impeded) by making price more (less) salient. Theoretical implications are discussed.","Ashok K. Lalwani; Lura Forcum"
43,2,"In Pursuit of Good Karma: When Charitable Appeals to Do Right Go Wrong","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 2, 1 August 2016, Pages 334–353, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw018","/jcr/article/43/2/334/2572285","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/2/334/2572285","This research examines the implications of consumers’ belief in karma—the belief that the universe bestows rewards for doing right and exacts punishments for doing wrong—in the context of prosocial behavior. Although intuitively, believing in karma should result in greater intentions to do right by supporting a charity, karmic beliefs are found to facilitate prosocial behavior only in contexts not associated with self-gains. A series of experiments shows that those with strong (vs. weak) beliefs in karma actually respond less favorably to charitable appeals that rely on common marketing tools meant to enhance consumer responses but that also cue self-gains by offering incentives or by highlighting self-benefits. However, these effects are only obtained for donations of time, which represent a means to enhance social connections, but not for donations of money. Consistent with the proposition that prosocial behaviors motivated by self-gains do not engender karmic rewards, lower intentions to do right among those with strong karmic beliefs are driven by a shift from other-focused to self-focused attention following appeals that cue self-gains, as compared to appeals that do not. Results imply that marketers need to take into account consumers’ karmic beliefs when seeking to incentivize prosocial behavior.","Katina Kulow; Thomas Kramer"
