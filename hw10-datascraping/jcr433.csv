43,3,"Men and the Middle: Gender Differences in Dyadic Compromise Effects","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 3, 1 October 2016, Pages 355–371, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw035","/jcr/article/43/3/355/2200141","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/3/355/2200141","Individual decision makers show robust tendencies toward choosing compromise options. But what happens when consumers make choices with someone else? This article examines the choice of compromise options in joint dyadic decisions. Findings reveal that preferences for compromise alternatives replicate in mixed-gender and female-female dyads as among individuals but are attenuated when two males make a choice together. Moreover, when two males make joint choices, their tendency to choose the compromise alternative decreases not only relative to other types of pairs but also to male and female individual decision makers. Evidence is presented that this happens because male-male dyadic contexts cue gender dichotomization, behavior that is consistent with masculine but not feminine gender norms. Because the extremity in decision making is maximally consistent with masculine but not feminine gender role norms, male-male dyads exhibit lower preferences for compromise options. However, if men have an opportunity to signal masculinity to one another prior to making joint compromise choices, male-male dyads prefer compromise options at proportions no different from female-female dyads. This work brings together the judgment and decision-making literature with insights from the social psychology literature, identifying a case when gender role norms have profound influences on classic judgment and decision-making effects.","Hristina Nikolova; Cait Lamberton"
43,3,"Slowing Down in the Good Old Days: The Effect of Nostalgia on Consumer Patience","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 3, 1 October 2016, Pages 372–387, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw033","/jcr/article/43/3/372/2199385","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/3/372/2199385","Nostalgia, which is induced by reminiscing about a positive past experience, can counteract loneliness and promote prosocial behavior. However, the process of recalling and thinking about a nostalgic experience can have quite different effects. Because nostalgic experiences rarely reoccur, people are motivated to savor them by prolonging the time they reminisce about them. The tendency to savor these experiences generalizes to situations that participants encounter later, thus increasing consumer patience. For this effect to emerge, however, consumers must be aware that waiting will be beneficial to the attainment of a benefit. Moreover, the relationship between nostalgia and consumer patience is diminished when people perceive a nostalgic experience to be repeatable or when they intensify their memory of the experience rather than prolonging it. Eight studies confirmed these effects and processes that underlie them.","Xun (Irene) Huang; Zhongqiang (Tak) Huang; Robert S. Wyer, Jr."
43,3,"Hedonic Escalation: When Food Just Tastes Better and Better","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 3, 1 October 2016, Pages 388–406, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw032","/jcr/article/43/3/388/2199201","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/3/388/2199201","Hedonic escalation is the increased liking of each additional bite of a palatable food. Hedonic escalation is more likely to occur when (1) a palatable food consists of a complex combination of flavors, and (2) a person is motivated to taste additional flavors on each successive bite. Consequently, hedonic escalation is more prevalent when people can identify more flavors (pilot study), attend to additional flavors on each taste trial (study 1), have an opportunity to identify an additional flavor on each taste trial (study 2), and isolate distinct flavors on each taste trial (study 3). Changes in hedonic escalation can be attributed to increased sensitization to flavors as opposed to changes in the rate of habituation (study 4). Hedonic escalation can also increase consumption (study 5) and influence food choices (study 6). Collectively, these studies show that hedonic escalation is enabled by the opportunity to identify an additional source of hedonic experience on each successive taste of a food.","Cammy Crolic; Chris Janiszewski"

Based on the store atmospherics literature, this article introduces interventions to optimize the pace of locomotion. A series of lab and field experiments demonstrates that changes in flooring affect customers’ walking speed. The number, the nature, and the relative salience of progress markers along a walking path toward a physical location communicate goal progress and thus the motivation to reach a particular destination. Consistent with a goal gradient account, customers walk faster when fewer progress markers are placed along the walking path to the goal. The effect of the number of progress markers diminishes when the markers are unrelated to the goal and reverses when the markers are relatively more salient than the goal. This article contributes to the goal literature by showing how markers affect perceptions of goal progress (i.e., level vs. rate of progress) and provides concrete insights to speed up and slow down customers’ walking speed in a retail environment.","Bram Van Den Bergh; Nico Heuvinck; Gaby A.

43,3,"Why Focusing on the Similarity of Substitutes Leaves a Lot to Be Desired","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 3, 1 October 2016, Pages 448–459, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw034","/jcr/article/43/3/448/2199927","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/3/448/2199927","Consumers frequently choose substitutes for products that are out of stock, unavailable, too unhealthy, or too expensive. A series of studies shows that focusing on differences between the substitute and the unattained alternative reduces the consumer’s desire for the unattained alternative more than focusing on similarities between them. Whether consumers were dieting, listening to songs, or consuming snacks in the lab, focusing on differences reduced their desire for the unattained alternative—and subsequent consumption of this item after consuming the substitute—more than focusing on similarities. This suggests that consumers can reduce overconsumption by focusing on how the substitutes they consume differ from the alternatives they wish to avoid.","Zachary G. Arens; Rebecca W. Hamilton"
43,3,"Repayment Concentration and Consumer Motivation to Get Out of Debt","Journal of Consumer Research, Volume 43, Issue 3, 1 October 2016, Pages 460–477, https://doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucw037","/jcr/article/43/3/460/2200459","https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/43/3/460/2200459","Many indebted consumers carry multiple credit cards with significant balances and do not generate enough income to pay off these balances in full at the end of each repayment period. In managing their debt over time, these consumers must decide how to allocate repayments across their debt accounts. This research examines how different monthly repayment allocations, varying from entirely concentrated into one debt account (i.e., a concentrated strategy) to equally dispersed across all debt accounts (i.e., a dispersed strategy), influence consumers’ motivation to repay their debts. Evidence from a field study of indebted consumers with multiple debt accounts and from three experiments shows that concentrated (vs. dispersed) repayment strategies tend to boost consumers’ motivation to become debt free, leading them to repay their debts more aggressively. Importantly, this motivating effect is most pronounced when the repayments are concentrated into consumers’ smallest accounts because consumers tend to infer overall progress in debt repayment from the greatest proportional balance reduction (proportion of starting balance repaid) within any one account. These findings advance our understanding of how consumers repay their debts and help pinpoint the psychological process by which debt repayment strategies affect consumers’ motivation to get out of debt.","Keri L.

The current work demonstrates an important case in which consideration targets are resistant to particular inferences, which leads such inferences to be applied instead to one’s environment. Specifically, when considering safety-oriented products, consumers exposed to unstable-looking brand logos infer the presence of unsafe conditions, and because safety-oriented products are resistant to inferences that they are unsafe, the inference is instead applied to the environment (i.e., “the environment is unsafe”). This process subsequently increases the perceived utility of safety-oriented products. Five experiments collectively demonstrate the core effect, uncover the underlying inferential mechanism, and demonstrate the crucial role of inference resistance in the process. Overall, the present findings suggest that in some cases, a logo design that is opposed to desired product or brand beliefs may ironically help in boosting demand.","Ryan Rahinel; Noelle M. Nelson"
