# Homework 05: Factor and figure management; Repo hygiene


This repo contains the **5th** homework submission for STAT 545A


## Contents:
- [HW 05 markdown file](hw05.md)
- [HW 05 R markdown file](hw05.Rmd)
- [Readme file](README.md)




## Reporting my Process:

Like previous assignments I first created the homework folder, README file and Rmd file where I created an outline for this homework assignment in my STAT 545 project file. 



I completed the join and reshaping assignments. I was a bit confused about creating a new data frame - I wasn't sure if we should make our own or download a new data frame. I decided to look for interesting data to create a csv file that I could import into R. The spread and gather commands as well as the joining commands took me a bit of time to get used to but now I feel more confident about using them.
