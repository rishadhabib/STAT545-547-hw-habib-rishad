## Reporting my Process:

I had a lot of fun on this assignment and ended up spending much longer than I probably should have trying to come up with new plots or ways of looking at the data. I found some interesting things that lead to me reading up on Libyan history a little.


New things I learnt:

- How to make a table of contents at the top in a very easy way: just add the following to the YAML at the top of your file as jenny mentions [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues/138)
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 4
- How to use geom_violin which is quite a nice way of representing data
- How to add multiple lines and labels to a graph: just add more geom functions which is really simple and easy once you know it
  + a nice solution to [labelling the end of lines ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29357612/plot-labels-at-ends-of-lines)
